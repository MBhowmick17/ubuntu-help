Install and setup vim on Ubuntu 14.04

<note> I have upgraded to Ubuntu 16.04 and wrote another post about setting up vim, this time using vundle instead of pathogen. Checkout the new post– vim and vundle on Ubuntu 16.04 – if that sounds interesting to you. </note>

Vim is a powerful editor that can be used on your laptop/desktop and is also typically found of any Linux server you might encounter. As a result, I started using vim as my main editor. The Ubuntu install is simple:

$ sudo apt-get install vim

That’s it, you’re ready to edit. A good place to start if you need to learn more about vim is the main website: vim . Also be sure to check out the vim tutorials.
Pathogen

My next step is to add a variety of vim plugins that make (my) life easier. To do this I use pathogen a wonderful vim package manager. Installation is accomplished with the following lines:

$ mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle;
$ curl -LSso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim https://tpo.pe/pathogen.vim

If you don’t have curl installed, use:

$ sudo apt-get install curl

and try the second line again. Finally, if you don’t have a ~/.vimrc file create the following minimal example:

" contents of minimal .vimrc
execute pathogen#infect()
syntax on
filetype plugin indent on

NERDTree

NERDTree is a plugin the provides a nice file browser with bookmarks. With pathogen available, getting NERDTree installed is as simple as:

$ cd ~/.vim/bundle
$ git clone https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git

After installing, start vim and type:

:NERDTreeToggle

to toggle the file browser open or closed. Use up and down arrows to select files and press enter to open file in current tab. To open in a new tab, select the file and press t.

To bookmark, select a directory and type:

:Bookmark bookmarkname

to assign bookmarkname to the desired directory. To toggle the bookmarks open or closed (while in the NERDTree window) press shift-b. Finally, to open a bookmark, select the bookmark using up/down arrows and press enter when the desired bookmark is highlighted.
